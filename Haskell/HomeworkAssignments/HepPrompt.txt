Write a function
hep :: [Word] -> [Word]
type Word = String
that takes a list of words (i.e., Strings not containing blanks), txt, and returns a list just like txt but
with the following substitutions made each time they appear as consecutive words in txt:
• you is replaced by u,
• are is replaced by r,
• your is replaced by ur,
• the three words by the way are replaced by the word btw,
• the three words for your information is replaced by the word fyi,
• boyfriend is replaced by bf,
• girlfriend is replaced by gf,
• the three words be right back are replaced by the word brb,
• the three words laughing out loud are replaced by the word lol,
• the two words see you are replaced by the word cya,
• the two words I will are replaced by the word I’ll, and
• great is replaced by gr8.
This list is complete (for this problem).
