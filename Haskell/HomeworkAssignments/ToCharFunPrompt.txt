In cryptography, one would like to apply functions defined over the
type Int to data of type Char. However, in Haskell, these two types are distinct. In Haskell, write a
function
toCharFun :: (Int -> Int) -> (Char -> Char)
that takes a function f, of type is Int -> Int, and returns a function that operates on characters. In your
implementation you can use the fromEnum and toEnum functions that Haskell provides (found in the
Enum instance that is built-in for the type Char).
Hint: note that (fromEnum 'a') is 97 and (toEnum 100) :: Char is 'd'.
