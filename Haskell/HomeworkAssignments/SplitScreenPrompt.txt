This is another problem about Window Layouts. Write a function
splitScreen :: String -> WindowLayout -> WindowLayout
that takes a string, name, and a Window Layout, wl, and returns a Window Layout that is just like wl,
except that for each window in wl whose wname is (== to) name is changed to a horizontal window layout
with both windows having the same name and half the width of the previous layout. (Hint, use Haskellâ€™s
div operator to do the division.)
Figure 2 on the next page shows examples.
As always, after writing your code, run our tests, and turn in your solution and the output of our tests.
