# Portfolio
A collection of software projects that I have worked on, sorted by Programming Language.
Many of these files contain code which I have developed for various programming assignments throughout my undergraduate study
at the University of Central Florida. This code is posted SOLELY to showcase my abilities as a programmer, and although
this is a public repository (for logistics purposes), under ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any of this code be accessed/used by any student to help with their studies.By accessing these files, the user agrees to refrain from any sort of academic dishonesty whatsoever.
