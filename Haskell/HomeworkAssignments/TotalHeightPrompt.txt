In Haskell, write a function
totalHeight :: WindowLayout -> Int
that takes a hWindowLayouti, wl, and returns the total height of the window layout. The height is
defined by cases as follows. The height of a hWindowLayouti of form
Window {wname = nm, width = w, height = h}
is h. The height of a hWindowLayouti of the form
Horizontal [wl1, . . ., wlm]
is 0 if the list is empty, and otherwise is the maximum of the heights of wl1 through wlm (inclusive).
The height of a hWindowLayouti of the form
Vertical [wl1, . . ., wln]
is the sum of the heights of wl1 through wlm (inclusive), which is 0 if the list is empty.
The file TotalHeightTests.hs contains tests that show how the function should work, see Figure 1 on
the following page.
Be sure to follow the grammar! In particular, you need to use some helping function to work on the lists
that are part of the hWindowLayouti grammar. We will take off points if you do not follow the grammar
(and you will spend more time trying to get your code to work).
