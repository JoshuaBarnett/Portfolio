# Schoolwork Portfolio
A collection of software projects that I have worked on for classes at the University of Central Florid, sorted by Programming Language.
This is a relatively limited collection, as I have tried my best to ensure that the only files uploaded are from "retired" assignments, so to speak -- I do not intend for this to be used as a resource for current students to commit acts of Academic Dishonesty, and as such have chose to exclude any projects that are still being used by professors (even in a slightly modified form). If it comes to my attention that any of these assignments are still being used, please contact me at joshua.d.barnett AT gmail DOT com, so I can remove the files in question.

Regards,
-Joshua
